# KNN-realization-binary-multiclass-classification-with-validation-datasets
Realization of the KNN machine learning algorithm (binary and multiclass classification) using validation datasets.
The main tool is the NumPy library.

# Files .py
Work.py - the main file

Metrics.py - a file with metrics of Recall, Precision, Accuracy, F1 score

KNN.py - a file with the implementation of distance calculation algorithms (Manhattan distance). Computing distances: two loops, one loop, no loops (full vectorization)

Dataset.py - a file with downloading datasets
